# Machine-Learning
Two machine learning problems solved in python. 
First problem was calculating the expected CO2 emission for cars. 
I solved it using sklearn's model for Linear regression aswell as my own that implements gradient descent.
The second problem is predicting wether a pastry is a cupcake or a muffin.
I used sklearn's implementation of KNN and again my own.

For both problems I first reviewed the input data, chose wich columns are important for the output based on the .png files in the plots directory.
Than I changed the format if needed, and trained my and the implemented model.

For both problems, there is also an additional function that is used to check which are the optimal input parameters for the model (alpha and number of iterations for Linear regression and number of neighbours for KNN).
